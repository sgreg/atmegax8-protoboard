# ATmega8X Protoboard
### No fuzz ISP connector board for ATmega48/88/168/328 DIP32

One of those nights where I started something fresh with an ATmega controller and had to detach my breadboard ISP connector adapter from another ongoig project, and I started to wish I wouldn't have to. Breadboards are messy enough without trying to fiddle out single wires. Plus it's some poorly soldered DIY adapter that might just lose a wire any day.

Some time later that night the ATmega8X Protoboard was designed and sent to OSH Park.

Really, nothing fancy, just a little PCB with place for a DIP32 ATmega, an ISP connector and a decoupling capacitor with connectors for a breadboard, i.e. the most basic components for *any* project.

The ISP connector is meant for ATmega48/88/168/328 series microcontrollers, I actually have not checked if others use the same pinout for ISP. If so, it's gonna work with those as well. **Use at your own risk.**

Repository contains KiCad schematics, PCB layout and Gerber files.
Once I received the PCBs and verified they work and fit to the breadboard, it'll be shared on OSH Park.
